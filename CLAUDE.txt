# StatCan Web Data Service MCP Server

This document outlines the development plan for creating an MCP server that interfaces with Statistics Canada's Web Data Service (WDS) to help users find, research, and analyze StatCan datasets.

## Project Overview

The StatCan MCP server will act as a bridge between Model Context Protocol (MCP) clients like Claude Desktop App and the Statistics Canada Web Data Service API. This will allow AI assistants to access and analyze Canadian statistical data, providing users with powerful, natural language-driven data exploration capabilities.

### Key Features

1. **Data Discovery** - Tools to search and browse available StatCan datasets
2. **Metadata Exploration** - Access detailed information about dataset structure and content
3. **Data Retrieval** - Extract specific time series and data points
4. **Basic Analysis** - Simple statistical operations and visualizations
5. **Change Tracking** - Monitor updates to datasets

## Technical Framework

### Architecture

The server will be built using Python with the MCP Python SDK, following a modular architecture:

   - **Solutions**:
     - Implement progressive loading with pagination controls
     - Create summarized views of large datasets (statistical summaries)
     - Support filters that limit data retrieval to what's needed
     - Use columnar storage formats (like Parquet) for efficient local caching
     - Leverage the TheRaLabs/legion-mcp server for database-backed storage

3. **Complex Metadata**
   - **Challenge**: StatCan data can have complex multidimensional structures
   - **Solutions**:
     - Download and index all dataset metadata for local fast access
     - Create simplified metadata views with the most important attributes
     - Develop natural language templates for common metadata queries
     - Build a metadata navigator tool with hierarchical browsing

> **Note on Attribution and Licensing**: When incorporating or adapting code from these existing MCP servers, we must properly attribute the original authors and comply with their respective licenses. Each integration should include appropriate citations in the code comments and documentation. We should also review the license terms of each repository to ensure our usage complies with their requirements before implementation.
