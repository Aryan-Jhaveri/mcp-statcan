## Known Limitations and Challenges

1. **StatCan WDS API Compatibility Issues**
   - The StatCan WDS API currently returns 406 Not Acceptable errors for many endpoints
   - This appears to be a change in the API requirements or access restrictions
   - We've implemented fallbacks with local data and caching to maintain functionality
   - Future updates will need to address these issues as the API evolves

2. **Data Retrieval Limitations**
   - Direct access to the full StatCan catalog may be limited due to API issues
   - Some data retrieval operations rely on cached or pre-downloaded example data
   - Vector ID-based retrieval is more reliable than cube coordinate-based retrieval

## Upcoming Features

1. **Advanced Analysis Tools**
   - More sophisticated forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet)
   - Anomaly detection with explanations
   - Multi-dimensional analysis and aggregation

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Enhanced hot cache preloading for popular datasets
   - Parallel data fetching for complex queries
   - Improved local data storage for API fallback

3. **Additional Data Sources**
   - Provincial statistical agencies
   - Specialized economics datasets
   - International comparative data

4. **Advanced Visualization**
   - Interactive dashboards
   - Customizable visualizations
   - Comparative multi-series charts
